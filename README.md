# Euler Project Problem 4 - Largest Palindrome Product
https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

**Challenge**
---
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

No attempt was made to be efficent, but instead was to validate what the true answer is.

In this approach, I decided to count backwards as there is no point going though all the small pointless numbers.
Next, I started using a traveling minimum for the for loops as going below the minimum number is always going to be a smaller end result.
The traveling maximum is not needed as the inner for loop only needs to start at where the outer for loop is currently.
